# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## Introduction

Fraud detection is a critical task in financial institutions, banks, and online platforms. It involves the use of advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. This documentation aims to provide an understanding of the approach taken in this Fraud Detection project.

## Methodology

This Fraud Detection project utilizes a Machine Learning Classification approach. The model used in this project is the XGBoost model, which is an implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. The model's performance is evaluated using the AUC-ROC curve.

## Data Preparation

Before feeding the data into the model, it undergoes a thorough cleaning and preprocessing stage. The following steps are carried out during this phase:

1. Missing values are imputed using a technique like mean imputation or mode imputation.
2. Outliers are detected and handled appropriately.
3. Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. The features are scaled or normalized using techniques like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

## Feature Engineering

The process of extracting features from raw data involves feature engineering. In this project, we use techniques like One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, and feature interaction. The extracted features are then fed into the XGBoost model for training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The XGBoost model is trained using the training data and the model's performance is evaluated using the test data. The model's performance is measured using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).

## Model Deployment

The trained model is then deployed in a production environment where it is used to make real-time predictions about whether a particular transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this Fraud Detection project uses a Machine Learning Classification approach, with the XGBoost model being the algorithm of choice. The project follows a rigorous approach to data preparation, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. This ensures accurate fraud detection and contributes to a safer and more secure financial environment.
